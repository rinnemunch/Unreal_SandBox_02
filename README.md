# 🥊 Project 3 – Melee Attack Animation Integration

This project shows how to **retarget and trigger melee attack animations** for Unreal Engine 5.5.4’s default Third-Person Character using the **IK Retargeter** and **Blueprint input logic**.

It’s the foundation for a full melee combat system — clean, responsive, and ready to expand into combos, hit detection, and impact feedback.

# 🎬 Project 4 – Cinematic Camera Fade-In on Begin Play

This project demonstrates how to create a **cinematic camera fade-in effect** in **Unreal Engine 5.5.4** using Blueprints.
It delivers a smooth visual transition from black to your scene at game start — a small, professional touch that sets the tone and boosts immersion instantly.

## 🧱 Features

- **BP_ThirdPersonCharacter** fade logic triggered on **Begin Play**
- Uses **Get Player Camera Manager** and **Start Camera Fade** nodes
- **From Alpha 1.0 → To Alpha 0.0** for full black-to-scene transition
- Adjustable **Fade Duration** for pacing control (e.g., 5 seconds for cinematic feel)
- Customizable **Fade Color** for tone or narrative mood

# 💥 Project 5 – Precise Melee Hits: Knockouts & Hit Detection

This project expands the **melee combat system** with **precise, reactive hit detection** and **ragdoll knockouts**, all built in **Unreal Engine 5.5.4** using Blueprints only.
It builds directly on the _Wandering AI_ and _Melee Combat_ setups — turning every swing into a physical, cinematic impact that connects cleanly with NPCs.

---

## 🖼️ Preview

---

## 🧱 Features

- **ANS_Hit** custom notify state defining the active hit window in the attack montage
- **Real-time hit detection** using `Sphere Trace for Objects` linked to animation notifies
- **BP_ThirdPersonCharacter** `HitDetection` function handling trace and NPC detection
- **BP_NPC** ragdoll response triggered instantly on successful hit
- **Add Impulse** physics push for knockout realism and visual impact
- Seamless integration with existing **AI wandering** and **melee attack** systems

---

## ⚙️ Technical Breakdown

- **Notify State Timing:** Active window covers attack swing (e.g., frame 10–53)
- **Trace Filtering:** Detects only `Pawn` object types for performance and precision
- **Hit Response:** Casts to `BP_NPC` and triggers `ActivateRagdoll()`
- **Physics Simulation:** Mesh simulation + directional impulse for knockout motion
- **Radius Control:** Adjustable trace radius (default: `50`) for close-range accuracy

---

## 🚀 Result

When you attack a wandering NPC, your melee swing now delivers a **real, timed impact**.
Each successful hit instantly drops the target into ragdoll with a subtle forward impulse — producing clean, satisfying knockouts that look and feel physically grounded.
